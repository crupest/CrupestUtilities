Here are some utilities written by me.

##SystemOfUnits
SystemOfUnits is a *compile-time-check* physical unit system written with *C++ template*.
It checks the dimension of each quantity and will report an error when some mistaken operations like plusing time and distance are applied.
It supports many operations so that you can use any quantity freely as if they were `double`.

##Event
Event is an event system just like what it is called.
